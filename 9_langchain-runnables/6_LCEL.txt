LCEL (LangChain Expression Language)

Instead of manually chaining objects step-by-step, LCEL uses operators (|) and composable building blocks 
(Runnable classes) to create a pipeline that can be invoked, streamed, batched, or even serialized without 
changing the core logic.

For example:

Instead of creating chain using RunnableSequence
  chain = RunnableSequence(r1, r2, r3)

We can use LCEL syntax as:
  chain = r1 | r2 | r3
